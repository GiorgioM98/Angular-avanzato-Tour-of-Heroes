## Introduction

This SPA is the evolution of ''Tour of Heroes'' previously created.


## Structure

The structure of the project is governed by the classic angular structure.
It is made up of various components that perform various functions.


## Technology used

I used several technologies to create this AngularApp:
Visual Studio Code, as an editor for writing code.
Angular to add the various features.
HTML for structure.
Typescript for various added features.
Css to add a touch of personal class.


## Usability

On the main screen you can view the crisis center with its list.
The various buttons lead to view the list of heroes, the Admin page, the Login page and the Contact page.
Each hero displayed gives the possibility to view their details by pressing on them, as well as the possibility of changing their name.
